# Run a 'create' in the background (--daemon) so devices don't vanish if the
# main daemon is stopped (since qemu's '-object input-linux' won't find it
# again at runtime automatically, although we could instead send hmp commands
# to re-add them at startup as an alternative setup)
# Since we want to be able to reconnect, let it use a socket (--listen=@vm0),
# tell it to accept new connections after EOF (--on-close=accept) and that new
# connections should simply resume existing input devices (--duplicates=resume)
# and finally that it should try to connect to an already existing instance
# (--connect) before starting a new one.

# Afterwards we can reset the names, but this is optional as it only affects
# netevent's internal state of the device names used when adding new outputs.
