SYNOPSIS
========

``netevent`` show *DEVICE* [\ *COUNT*\ ]

``netevent`` cat [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] *DEVICE*

``netevent`` create [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] *DEVICE*

``netevent`` daemon [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] *SOCKETNAME*

``netevent`` command *SOCKETNAME* *COMMAND*

OPTIONS
=======

Some options can be used on multiple commands.

All subcommands:
----------------

``-h, --help``
    Show a short usage message.

``netevent create``
----------------------------------------

``--duplicates=``\ *MODE*
    Change how duplicate devices are to be treated. *MODE* can be:

    ``reject``

        The default. If a device with an already existing ID is received, treat
        this as an error and exit.

    ``resume``

        Assume the source was restarted and is sending the same device again.
        Currently this does not verify whether that's actually the case.

    ``replace``

        Remove the previous device and replace it with the new one.
        Since ``resume`` does not verify the device, this is the preferred mode
        if the destination event device node does not need to be persistent.

``--listen=``\ *SOCKETNAME*
    Rather than reading from stdin, listen on the specified unix (or abstract
    if prefixed with "@") socket.

``--connect``
    Used together with ``--listen`` this causes netevent to first try to
    connect to the socket. If successful, it'll pass events through to the
    instance it connected to. Otherwise, if ``--daemonize`` was also specified,
    it'll fork off a new instance to which it connects first. If
    ``--daemonize`` was not specified it'll return an error code.

``--on-close=end|accept``
    When using ``--listen``, this option decides how to proceed after a client
    disconnects. The default is to ``accept`` a new client and resume according
    to the configured ``--duplicates`` mode. Alternatively ``end`` can be used
    to cause the main loop to exit successfully.

``--daemonize``
    Run as a background daemon. When using ``--listen`` it may also desirable
    to run netevent in the background.

``netevent cat`` and ``netevent create``
----------------------------------------

``-l, --legacy``
    Use a netevent 1 compatible protocol.

``--no-legacy``
    Use a netevent 2 compatible protocol. This is the default.

``netevent cat`` and ``netevent show``
--------------------------------------

``-g, --grab``
    Grab the input device to prevent it from also firing events on the system.
    This is the default.

``-G, --no-grab``
    Do not grab the input device.

``netevent daemon``
-------------------

``-s, --source=``\ *FILE*
    Run commands from the specified file. Can be specified multiple times.
    This can be used to fully setup the daemon with outputs, devices and
    hotkeys. See the `DAEMON COMMANDS` section for details.

DAEMON COMMANDS
===============

``action set`` *EVENT* *COMMAND*
    Queue a command when an event occurs. The command can contain semicolons
    to execute multiple commands. Multiple parameters will be concatenated with
    a space.

    The following events currently exist:

    * ``output-changed``
        Executed on a ``use`` command or when an output device fails and a
        fallback is being activated.
    * ``grab-changed``
        Executed whenever the ``grab`` command is used.
    * ``device-lost``
        Executed whenever a device we are reading from disappears.

    These commands are executed immediately after such an event has occurred.
    Note that there's nothing preventing you from building an endless loop by
    adding event-triggering commands in this place, so, just don't.

``action remove`` *EVENT*
    Remove a command bound to an event.

``nop``
    Nothing. Bind as hotkey to ignore an event and be explicit about it.

``grab``\  *on*\ \|\ *off*\ \|\ *toggle*
    Set the grabbing state. Currently this also controls whether events are
    passed to the current output.

``use`` *OUTPUT*
    Set the current output.

``output add`` [``--resume``] *OUTPUT_NAME* *OUTPUT_SPEC*
    Add a new output. *OUTPUT_NAME* can be an arbitrary name used later for
    ``output remove`` or ``use`` commands. *OUTPUT_SPEC* can currently be
    either a file/fifo, a command to pipe to when prefixed with *exec:*, or the
    name of a unix or abstract socket when using *unix:/path* or
    *unix:@abstractName*. See the examples above.

    If the ``--resume`` parameter is provided, assume the destination already
    knows all the existing devices and do not recreate them.

``output remove`` *OUTPUT_NAME*
    Remove an existing output.

``output use`` *OUTPUT_NAME*
    Long version of ``use`` *OUTPUT_NAME*.

``exec`` *COMMAND*
    Execute a command. Mostly useful for hotkeys.

``source`` *FILE*
    Execute daemon commands from a file.

``quit``
    Cause the daemon to quit.

``hotkey add`` *DEVICE_NAME* *EVENT* *COMMAND*
    Add a hotkey to an existing device. *DEVICE* is the name used when
    adding the device via ``device add``. *EVENT* is an event specification
    of the form *TYPE*:*CODE*:*VALUE*, as printed out by ``netevent show``.
    *COMMAND* is a daemon command to be executed when the event is read.

``hotkey remove`` *DEVICE_NAME* *EVDENT*
    Remove a hotkey for an event on a device.

``device add`` *DEVICE_NAME* *EVENT_DEVICE_FILE*
    Register an evdev device.

``device remove`` *DEVICE_NAME*
    Remove an evdev device.

``device rename`` *DEVICE_NAME* *NEW_NAME*
    Rename a device. Useful when adding output of which the devices should have
    a recognizable name.

``device reset-name`` *DEVICE_NAME*
    Reset a device's name to its default.

``device set-persistent`` *DEVICE_NAME* *BOOL*
    Change whether a device's removal should be announced to the outputs.

``info``
    Show current inputs, outputs, devices and hotkeys.

DAEMON ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
============================

The daemon will maintain the following environment variables to provide some
information to commands executed via an ``exec`` hotkey:

* ``NETEVENT_OUTPUT_NAME``
    This will contain the name of the output currently in use.

* ``NETEVENT_GRABBING``
    This will be "1" if the daemon is currently grabbing, or "0" if it is not.
    Note that with multiple input devices, failure to grab an input device will
    cause this variable to be in an undefined state.
