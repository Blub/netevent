* Test the code without HAS_UI_DEV_SETUP
* Some TODOs found in the code? There should be at least one...
* a) INotify to listen to devices being created?
  b) Use systemd service files to tell the daemon about new devices?
* SystemD service file examples for .config/systemd/user ?
* Broadcast a keep-alive/ping packet every some seconds.
