* Perhaps a per-input-device NETEVENT_GRABBING env var?
  Either multiple vars or one with a space separated `name=0|1` list...
* Some TODOs found in the code? There should be at least one...
* a) INotify to listen to devices being created?
  b) Use systemd service files to tell the daemon about new devices?
* Broadcast a keep-alive/ping packet every some seconds.
